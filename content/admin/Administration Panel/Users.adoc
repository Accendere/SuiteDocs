= Users

== Overview

This guide documents the settings on the Users section of the Administration panel.

A *user* represents someone who can log in to your *SuiteCRM* system. 
In addition to the basic information (name, title, address, phone number etc) 
contained in the *Employees* module, a user has a username and password 
to enable them to log in to the system, and an email address. When a new User 
is created in SuiteCRM, a matching Employee record is created. Similarly, when a 
new Employee record is created, a new User record is also created. 
This new user record will need to be edited (if required) to add a username/password 
and email address before it can be used to log in to *SuiteCRM*.

The *Users* section of the *Administration Panel* holds settings for *SuiteCRM* 
user accounts and security access settings. 

{{%notice note %}}You must have Administrator access to add new user accounts and 
edit access settings. Regular users have access to their own user account details 
and can edit address details, set preferences, set up personal email and change 
their password.{{% /notice %}}

Open the Administration panel by selecting *Admin* from the dropdown at the top 
right-hand of the *SuiteCRM* screen.

image:UsersCreateUser.png["Create new user"]

On the default *User Profile* tab, enter the new username, user's first and last 
names and the account status (Active or Inactive). 

{{%notice info %}}Only *Active* accounts can be used to log in to *SuiteCRM*. 
In addition, *Inactive* account usernames are not included in dropdown username 
lists (e.g. assigned to or modified by lists) used for record searching.{{% /notice %}}

Select the User Type from the drop down. A System Administrator User can 
access the Administration panel and all records in *SuiteCRM*. A regular user 
has access to modules and records based on the role(s) assigned to them. See 
the <<Role Management, Role Management>> section of this document for further 
information.

An optional photograph can be attached to the user record. Browse for the required 
file using the btn:[Choose file] button. The photo will be displayed on the detail 
view of the user record once the record has been saved.

Two Factor Authentication can be enabled on a per-user basis. Once enabled, a

to *SuiteCRM*.

Information panel. Changes made here will be reflected in the corresponding 
Employee record.

Management settings will apply. Passwords will be managed by SAML settings.

= Roles and Security Group Settings

Security Suite allows you to restrict access to sensitive data in *SuiteCRM* 
to specific teams (groups). There are many options to allow you to configure it
to your exact needs, and a number of automatic assignment
options to ensure that your users can always access the data that you
need.

*Roles* are used to define access rights to modules and determine what a 
user can do with a record once they have access to it.

*Security Groups* allow you to define groups of users with particular access rights 
defined by the roles attached to the group.

=== Role Management

==== Create Role

Select Role Management, and then Create Role from the Role Management sidebar.
Enter a name and a description for the role you are creating.

=== Security Suite Management

==== Create Group

=== Security Suite Settings

SuiteCRM System Administrators can configure many advanced options for
Security Suite. This allows you to control various access/rights,
inheriting of records, filters and more.

image:SecurityGroupsConfigure.png[title="Security Groups Management: Configure"]

==== Additive Rights

User gets greatest rights of all roles assigned to the user or the user's
group(s)

==== Strict Rights

If a user is a member of several groups only the respective rights from
the group assigned to the current record are used.

==== New User Group Popup

If this is checked, a Security Groups popup will open when a new user is created, 
allowing you to add the user to a security group(s)

==== User Role Precedence

If any role is assigned directly to a user that role should take
precedence over any group roles.

==== Filter User List

With this selected, non-admin users can only assign records to users who are in the same group(s)

==== Use Creator Group Select

Adds a panel to a record creation screen if a user is a member of more
than one inheritable group that allows a user to select one or more
groups (that the user belongs to) that should be associated with the newly
created record. If a user is in just one group the normal inheritance
rules will instead be applied.

{{% notice note %}}
The new record will still inherit from the Assigned To user or
Parent record if these options are set. This setting only overrides the
Created By setting.
{{% /notice %}}

==== Inherit from Created By User

The record will inherit all the groups assigned to the user who created it.

==== Inherit from Assigned To User

The record will inherit all the groups of the user assigned to the record.
{{% notice note %}}Other groups assigned to the record will NOT be removed.{{% /notice %}}

==== Inherit from Parent Record

E.g. If a case is created for a contact the case will inherit the groups
associated with the contact.

==== Inbound email account

Locks down inbound email accounts in the email client to only list those
that belong to the same group as the current user.

==== Default Groups for New Records

Set groups that should always be attached when a specific module record is
created, e.g. you can set a group to be assigned to all newly created Account records.
