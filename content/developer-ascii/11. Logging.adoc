11. Logging
~~~~~~~~~~~

[[leanpub-auto-logging-messages]]
Logging messages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Logging in SuiteCRM is achieved by accessing the log global. Accessing
an instance of the logger is as simple as

Example 11.1: Accessing the log

'''''

....
$GLOBALS['log']
....

'''''

This can then be used to log a message. Each log level is available as a
method. For example:

Example 11.2: Logging messages

'''''

....
1 $GLOBALS['log']->debug('This is a debug message');
2 $GLOBALS['log']->error('This is an error message');
....

'''''

This will produce the following output:

Example 11.3: Logging messages example output

'''''

....
1 Tue Apr 28 16:52:21 2015 [15006][1][DEBUG] This is a debug message
2 Tue Apr 28 16:52:21 2015 [15006][1][ERROR] This is an error message
....

'''''

Logging output
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The logging output displays the following information by default:

Example 11.4: Logging messages example output

'''''

....
<Date> [<ProcessId>][<UserId>][<LogLevel>] <LogMessage>
....

'''''

`<Date>`::
  The date and time that the message was logged.
`<ProcessId>`::
  The PHP process id.
`<UserId>`::
  The ID of the user that is logged into SuiteCRM.
`<LogLevel>`::
  The log level for this log message.
`<LogMessage>`::
  The contents of the log message.

Log levels
^^^^^^^^^^

Depending on the level setting in admin some messages will not be added
to the log e.g if your logger is set to `error` then you will only see
log levels of `error` or higher (`error`, `fatal` and `security`).

The default log levels (in order of verbosity) are:

* `debug`
* `info`
* `warn`
* `deprecated`
* `error`
* `fatal`
* `security`

Generally on a production instance you will use the less verbose levels
(probably `error` or `fatal`). However whilst you are developing you can
use whatever level you prefer. I prefer the most verbose level -
`debug`.
