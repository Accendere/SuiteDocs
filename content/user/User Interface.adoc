interactions that take place between these entities and your
organisation.

allowing you to view the return on investment (ROI) and many other
useful metrics. This in turn helps you to plan your strategic marketing

Campaigns is the link:#Campaign_Summary[Campaign Summary] page, Email

== Campaign Wizard Templates

image:81Campaign_template.png[81Campaign_template.png,title="81Campaign_template.png"]

This page is a WYSIWYG Newsletter Template editor so you can create a
template for your marketing emails.

image:82Campaign_template.png[82Campaign_template.png,title="82Campaign_template.png"]

The panel at the top presents you with three options which allows you to
select an existing template, create a brand new template or copy an
existing template.

* Select an existing template – You can select from a drop down list of
existing Email Templates
* Create a brand new template – If you wish to start the Newsletter from
scratch then you can select this option.
* Copy an existing template – Allows you select an existing template and

Once you have chosen an Email Template you can decide you want to insert
a Tracker URL. This can be used to insert a link to your organisation's
website or direct link to a new product that you have launched. Also,
you are given the opportunity to place an 'Opt Out' link in your
template.

image:83Campaign_template.png[83Campaign_template.png,title="83Campaign_template.png"]

Please note that the 'Opt Out' link is added to the template
automatically even if you do not insert one at this point. Another
interesting feature of the Email Templates page is the ability to
personalise your templates by inserting variables. You can for example
insert the 'Account ID' variable in the subject line, or even insert the
addressee's first name and last name to add a more personal touch.

image:84Campaign_template.png[84Campaign_template.png,title="84Campaign_template.png"]

The WYSIWYG editor is displayed at the bottom of the Email Template
page, this editor allows you to visualise how your template will
actually look.

different layout components to your template. These then can be edited

type can be selected, formatted, colours changed, text alignment chosen,
images and even videos can be inserted.

fields. Once you are satisfied with your Email Settings and Schedule you
can click Next and you will be taken to the Summary page which is the
final stage of the Campaign Wizard.

== Campaign Wizard Summary

image:Newsletter_Summary_Review.png[Newsletter_Summary_Review.png,title="Newsletter_Summary_Review.png"]

the Campaign Wizard has been completed satisfactorily. If a section is
complete then this is shown with green tick icon, otherwise this will be
highlighted with a red cross icon. If any section has not been completed
then SuiteCRM will not permit the Campaign to be sent. In this instance
in the image shown above the 'Choose Targets' section has not been
completed correctly as indicated by the red cross icon. This would be
resolved by clicking back to the Target List page and specifying a
Subscription List with at least one entry. Once you have ensured all
sections are complete then you can choose one of three options:

* Send Mail at Scheduled Time – You can click this once you are sure all
sections of the Campaign are set correctly and are confident that it is
the finished article.
* Send Marketing Email as Test – This option gives you the opportunity
to send out your Campaign to your Test List that you specified in the
Subscriptions section of the Campaign Wizard. By doing this you can view
the Campaign as a recipient and double check that the Campaign appears
as it should do before sending out to real prospective/live customers.

View of the Campaign record you have just created through the Newsletter
Campaign Wizard.

Lead, Contact or Target. On selecting the person type you would like to
create the Available Fields dynamically change. Once you have chosen
this you can drag and drop the fields you would like to include on your
web form. Fields dropped into the First Form Column area are displayed
on the left side of your web form and the fields dropped into the Second
Form Column area are displayed on the right side of your web form. You
can choose to have 1 or 2 columns, all on the left side, right side or
on both sides. Please note as a minimum you need to include the required
fields included in your web form as indicated by an asterisk. Once you

click Save Web Form. On clicking this button you can either click on the
link to download the web form you have just created or copy and paste
the html to an existing document. By clicking the download link this
will save the html form in your download folder.

image:92Createperson_form.png[92Createperson_form.png,title="92Createperson_form.png"]

Please note that the web form will not be stored anywhere else on the
CRM, to ensure the html is saved please carry out one of the two steps
above.
