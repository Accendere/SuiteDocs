= Email Settings

== Mail Accounts Overview

Configuring email for *SuiteCRM* provides a wide range of features, including sending personal emails to contacts, automatic creation of cases, sending notifications for events using link:../advanced-open-workflow/[workflows] and sending email marketing link:../campaigns/[campaigns]. This document explains the different types of mail accounts and how to set them up. See link:../emails[Emails] for a guide to using the Emails module. 


Several different types of account can be configured within *SuiteCRM* for different purposes. These are:

=== Outgoing Mail 

The outgoing mail server is used to send automatic email notifications (such as record assignment notifications) and emails sent as link:../advanced-open-workflow[workflow] actions. 

The outgoing mail configuration will need to be set up by an Administrator.

See <<Outgoing Mail Configuration Settings>> for instructions on setting up the default outgoing mail configuration.

Other outbound accounts can be configured in addition to the default account for specific purposes, such as sending link:../campaigns[campaigns]. These can be set up from the Admin panel, under outbound accounts. If no other outbound accounts are configured, the default outgoing mail server account will be used.


=== Personal Accounts

A personal account is used to view and send email from a personal email account within the Emails module. This account can be an internal or an external email account. 
Emails from personal accounts are not stored in *SuiteCRM* unless manually imported. 

Personal accounts can be configured by the user from their user profile. Administrators can configure personal accounts for other users.

See <<Personal Email Account Settings>> for instructions on setting up a personal account.

			
=== Group Accounts
Group accounts are used when you need several users to be able to view and send email from one mail account, for example a support or sales mailbox. Group accounts can be set up to automatically import emails and create link:../cases[Cases] from incoming email.

Group accounts must be set up by an Administrator. Access to a group account must be granted by an Administrator.

See <<Group Email Account Settings>> for instructions on setting up a group account.


=== Bounce Handling Accounts
A Bounce Handling account is used with link:../campaigns[Campaigns] to handle bounced mail notifications when emails are undelivered. You will need to set up a Bounce Handling account in order to send a Campaign.

Bounce Handling accounts must be set up by an Administrator. Once set up, users can select the bounce handling account when setting up a campaign.

See <<Bounce Handling Account Settings>> for instructions on setting up a Bounce Handling account.

== Outgoing Mail Configuration Settings

The default system outbound mail settings are used to send system notification emails such as password reset emails, record assignment notifications and link:../advanced-open-workflow[workflow] email notifications.

{{%notice note %}}You will need administrator access to set up the system outbound account

* *Allow users to use this account for outgoing mail* When this option selected, all users will be able to send emails using this outgoing mail account, which is the same as that used to send system notifications and alerts. If the option is not selected,
users can still use the outgoing mail server after providing their own account information.

Click btn:[SEND TEST EMAIL] to check your settings. You will be asked to enter an email address for the test message to be sent to. A verification message will be displayed if the email was sent successfully. Check that you have received this test message.

Once the settings have been verified, be sure to click btn:[SAVE] so that these settings are retained.
