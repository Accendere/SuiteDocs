= Emails

== Introduction

Configuring email for *SuiteCRM* provides a wide range of features, including sending personal emails to contacts, automatic creation of cases, sending notifications for events using link:../advanced-open-workflow/[workflows] and sending email marketing link:../campaigns/[campaigns]. This document explains the different types of mail accounts and how to set them up as well as a guide to using the *Emails* module. 


== Email Settings 

=== Overview

Several different types of account can be configured within *SuiteCRM* for different purposes. These are:


==== Outgoing Mail 

Set up an outgoing mail server to sending automatic email notifications (such as record assignment notifications) and emails sent as link:../advanced-open-workflow[workflow] actions. 
You will need to be an administrator to do this. 

See <<Outgoing Mail Configuration Settings>> for instructions.

Other outbound accounts can be configured in addition to the default account for specific purposes, such as sending link:../campaigns[campaigns]. These can be set up from the Admin panel, under outbound accounts. If no other outbound accounts are configured, the default outgoing mail server account will be used.


==== Personal Accounts

Set up a personal account to view and send email from a personal account within the Emails module. Emails will not be stored in *SuiteCRM* unless manually imported. 

Personal accounts can be configured by the user from their user profile. Administrators can configure personal accounts for other users.

See <<Personal Email Account Settings>> for instructions on setting up a personal account.


			
==== Group Accounts
Set up a group account when you need several users to be able to view and send email from one mail account, for example a support or sales mailbox. Group accounts can be set up to automatically import and create records and Cases from incoming mail.

Group accounts must be set up by an Administrator user. 

See <<Group Email Account Settings>> for instructions on setting up a group account.



==== Bounce Handling Accounts
A Bounce Handling account is used with link:../campaigns[Campaigns] to handle bounced mail notifications when emails are undelivered. You will need to set up a Bounce Handling account in order to send a Campaign.

Bounce Handling accounts must be set up by an Administrator. Once set up, users can select the bounce handling account when setting up a campaign.

See <<Bounce Handling Account Settings>> for instructions on setting up a Bounce Handling account.

=== Outgoing Mail Configuration Settings

The default system outbound mail settings are used to send system notification emails such as password reset emails, record assignment notifications and link:../advanced-open-workflow[workflow] email notifications.

{{%notice note %}}You will need administrator access to set up the system outbound account
{{% /notice %}}

Open the *Admin* panel and select *Email Settings* from the *Email* section. Enter the required configuration information for your system. 
image:290EmailsSettings.png[default system settings]

* *Allow users to use this account for outgoing mail* When this option selected, all users will be able to send emails using this outgoing mail account, which is the same as that used to send system notifications and alerts. If the option is not selected,
users can still use the outgoing mail server after providing their own account information.

Click btn:[SEND TEST EMAIL] to check your settings. You will be asked to enter an email address for the test message to be sent to. A verification message will be displayed if the email was sent successfully. Check that you have received this test message.

Once the settings have been verified, be sure to click btn:[SAVE] so that these settings are retained.

==== Email Options

=== Personal Email Account Settings

Setting up a personal email account in *SuiteCRM* allows the user to view personal mail accounts within the *Emails* module. Emails from personal mailboxes are not stored in the *SuiteCRM* database unless manually <<Importing Mail,imported>>. 
Settings for personal email accounts are held within the user's profile. 

{{% notice note %}}
Individual users can set up their own personal accounts. Administrators can set up personal accounts for other users from the user profile in User Management.

This documentation is for *SuiteCRM* versions 7.9.x and later. For earlier versions of *SuiteCRM*, please see link:../emails-lts/[Emails-LTS].
{{% /notice %}}

=== Changes to the Emails Module

In previous releases, *SuiteCRM* synchronised email headers before the user could view mail. From 7.9. onward, *SuiteCRM* contacts the emails server directly, retrieving only the minimal information needed to process an operation. This eliminates the synchronisation process and significantly reduces the amount of email information that needs to be stored in the database. 
If you are upgrading from a version of *SuiteCRM* prior to 7.9.x, please see the <<Upgrading, Upgrading>> section of this document.

=== Overview

The *Emails* module in *SuiteCRM* allows Users to view, store, compose, send and receive email from their own personal email account or a shared inbox, for example a Support or Sales inbox. 
Emails can be imported and associated with a related *SuiteCRM* record, for example a Contact or an Account. These related emails can then be viewed on the history subpanel of the related record.

{{% notice note %}}
You will need to set up and have access to at least one *personal* or *group* email account in order to use the *Emails* module. 
{{% /notice %}}

The *Emails* Module can be found on the *All* menu on the top navigation bar. The module opens in List View, showing all the the mail from the default mail account inbox in the main window. 

image:250EmailsListView.png[title="Emails Module List View"]

The current inbox name is displayed on the button to the top right-hand side of the list view. Use this button to switch between accounts or other monitored folders.

|===

=== Import Mail

Email can be imported into *SuiteCRM* and associated with a relevant *SuiteCRM* record (e.g. a contact or account record). This can be very useful in keeping a history of communication with a client, for example.
Emails which have been imported and related to a record in *SuiteCRM* can be viewed from the record's history subpanel.

==== Import Single Email

An individual email can be imported from *Detail* view. Open the email, and then select *Import* from the *Actions* dropdown menu.

image:268bEmailsImport.png[title="Import emails"]

==== Import One or More Emails

One or more emails can be imported at the same time from *List* view. Select the email(s) you wish to import using the checkboxes to the left-hand side of the view. Select *Import* from the *Bulk Action* menu.

image:268aEmailsImport.png[title="Import emails"]

On importing, a dialog will open allowing you to select which record to relate the email(s) to. 

image:268EmailsImportDialog.png[title="Import emails"]

First select the module type from the drop-down.  Now use the search arrow button to find and select the relevant record, or begin typing the name into the field and select the required record from the auto-complete list. Click the btn:[OK] button.

Note that if you are bulk importing mail, all emails will be related to the record selected here. If you need to relate mail to different records you will need to import these individually.

*SuiteCRM* can also be configured to automatically import emails for group mail accounts. See <<Setting up A Group Email Account, Group Email Accounts>> for more information.

=== Delete Mail
As only imported emails are stored in *SuiteCRM*, only imported email records can be deleted from the *Emails* module. 

To delete an imported email record, open the email and then select Delete from the Actions menu dropdown. Note that this will only delete the SuiteCRM record and not the imap message. To remove emails from the Emails module, you will need to move or delete them using your external mail client.




== Email Templates

=== Introduction

Email templates are created from the *Email Templates* module which can be opened from the All menu.

image:300EmailsTemplates.png[Email Templates] 

There are a number of default system templates which are created on install. These are used to send out system notifications such as new passwords or case updates. These can be viewed and edited here alongside user-generated templates. Templates created here can also be used in link:../advanced-open-workflow[Workflows] and link:../campaigns[Campaigns] for example, as well as for system notifications.

Click on a template name to view the template. 

To edit an existing template, either open the template and select Edit from the Actions menu, or click the pencil icon to the left of the template name. Once in Edit mode, the template can be edited in the same way as <<Creating a template, creating a template>>.

=== Creating an Email Template

Select *Create Email Template* from the sidebar. This Create view will also appear if you choose to create a template from within another module such as link:../advanced-open-workflow[Workflows], for example. Select *Email*, *Campaign* or *System* depending on the use for the template. *System* templates are used to send system generated notifications such as case updates.

image:301EmailsNewTemplate.png[New email template]

==== Body

To add text to the body of the template, click, drag and drop one of the layouts from the selection in the left-hand pane into the onto the body. You can add as many layout sections as required. Overwrite the demo text by first highlighting it.

==== Adding Variables
To add a variable, select the appropriate module and field name from the drop-down lists. The corresponding variable name will be displayed in the last field.

image:302EmailsInsertVariable.png[Insert template variable]

You can either enter this variable manually, or click btn:[ADD VARIABLE] to insert the variable at the cursor point. Variables can be added to the subject line as well as the body of the email template.

image:303EmailsInsertVariable2.png[Template variable in subject and body]


==== Attachments

[cols="20,80",frame="none", grid="none"]
|===
|image:304EmailsTemplateAttachment.png[Template attachments]|Click btn:[BROWSE] to attach an external file or btn:[DOCUMENTS] to attach a *SuiteCRM* document to the template. Further items can be attached in the same way. The attached file(s) will be sent to all recipients of the template.
|===

==== Security Groups

Restrict access to a template by selecting a Security Group. 

== Upgrading
If you are upgrading from a version of *SuiteCRM* prior to *7.9.x*, you will need to use the *Sync Inbound Email Account Tool* on upgrading. This tool will synchronise mail already imported into *SuiteCRM* with your current IMAP accounts so that you will not have to synchronise in the future.

The Sync Inbound Email Accounts tool goes through all the selected inbound email accounts and updates them to support new features in *SuiteCRM* 7.9 onwards:

* Connects to the email server (via IMAP)
* Downloads the email header information
* Determines the orphaned status of emails
* Updates the unique ID for each email
* Corrects synchronisation problems

When running the tool, you will see the progression of each process. When an error occurs, you can run the tool on the other accounts which are working. The details of each error can be found in the suitecrm.log file.
