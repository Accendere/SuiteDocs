= Advanced Modules

By now, you should have a fundamental understanding of the SuiteCRM user
interface, basic modules, layouts, creating, searching and managing
records.

The next section of this User Guide covers in detail the Advanced CRM
modules. SuiteCRM has Advanced CRM modules which allow Users to further
enhance your Sales Force Automation Capabilities and improve business
processes.

== Advanced Open Sales

The first 'Suite' of advanced modules is AOS(Advanced Open Sales). The
various modules that are part of the AOS suite of modules allow you to
manage the Post-Opportunity Sales processes such as Quoting, Invoicing
and recurring Contracting. This functionality is made available to you
through the following modules:

* *Product Categories*
* *Products*
* *PDF Templates*
* *Quotations*
* *Invoices*
* *Contracts*

=== AOS Settings

System Administrator users can alter the settings for AOS using the AOS
Settings page under the Advanced OpenSales panel within the Admin Panel.

image:172AOS_Settings.png[title="AOS Settings"]

You can customise the following settings within the AOS Settings:

* *Renewal Reminder Period* – This defines how many days before the
Contract End Date that a reminder call should be created.
* *Initial Invoice Number* – Allows users to set the initial invoice
number. For example 20001.
* *Initial Quote Number* – Allows users to set the initial quote number.
For example 456.
* *Enable Line Items Groups* – If selected then users will be able to
bundle line items into groups. If this is not selected then you will not
be able to use the AOS Group functionality. 
{{% notice note %}}
This setting should
be selected before using AOS – It is difficult to migrate from/to groups
once Quotes/Invoices have been created.
{{% /notice %}}
* *Add Tax to Line Total* – If this is selected then the Tax will be added
into the Line Total on Line Items. If this is not the selected the Line
Total will not include Tax.

image:173AOS_settings_edit.png[title="Customise AOS Settings"]

Once configured, click 'Save' to apply your AOS Settings.

=== Products Module

You can create Product records using the Products module. Creating
products allows users to select product lines when preparing Quotes
using AOS. The products module allows users to specify the Products
Name, Part Number, Category and Type. Additional fields for Products can
be added using Studio.

image:174Products_module.png[title="Products Module"]

The module also allows users to define a Cost and Price for the product.
Price is the selling price which will be used in the quoting process. A
related Contact can be associated to the product. This is the point of
contact with the supplier concerning this product. If you have an Image
of the product then this can be uploaded within the products record. A
URL to the products page on your website can also be specified.

=== Products Categories Module

The Product Categories module allows Users to structure Products into a
hierarchical category structure. To create a Product Category record,
navigate to the Product Categories module and click the 'Create Product
Categories' button in the action bar.

image:175Product_category.png[title="Product Categories Module"]

The Parent Category field is a relationship field to another Product
Categories record. If you check the 'Is Parent Category' field then this
signifies that the category is the highest level. Once selected you will
not be able to select a Parent Category using the relate field.

=== PDF Templates

[discrete]
===== Creating Templates

AOS allows users to generate PDF documents and merge data from SuiteCRM
modules. You must however create a PDF template first.

image:176PDF_template.png[title="Create PDF Template"]

This module provides a WYSIWYG interface to create dynamic PDF
templates. You must select a Type. This is the module you are building
the PDF Template for. By default the modules you can select are: Quotes
Invoices Accounts Contacts Leads

System Administrator users can extend this list by editing the
'pdf_template_type_dom' using the drop down editor functionality. Please
note that the drop down 'Item Name' must be the name of the module
directory.

To insert fields into the Body of the template users will first select a
module. This will be the either the same module as the Type or a related
module to the Type module. This is selected using the first drop down on
the Insert Fields row.

image:177PDF_template_field.png[title="PDF Template Field"]

This will populate the second drop down with all the fields found within
that module. Once you have selected the field you wish to insert, the
text field will populate with the field variable name. Click 'Insert' to
place this field into the Body of the template. If the Active check box
is selected then users will be able to generate PDFs from this template.
If it is not selected you will not.

[discrete]
===== Loading Samples

image:178PDF_template_field.png[title="Loading Samples"]

AOS comes with seven pre-defined PDF templates to help you create your
own. These can be loaded by selecting the appropriate template from the
Load Sample drop down list.

image:image86.png[image86.png,title="image86.png"]

[discrete]
===== Line Items

When using a sample to create a template for Quotes or Invoices the Line
Items are formatted within a table. You can change the fields found in
this table as well as add or remove columns. Please note that if you are
creating the template from scratch you must format the Line Items
section as a table.

image:image87.png[image87.png,title="image87.png"]


[discrete]
===== Margins

At the bottom of the PDF Template Edit View, you can specify the margin
width for the PDF output.

image:187PDF_Margins.png[title="PDF Margins"]

[discrete]
===== Header and Footer

Within the PDF Templates Edit View, you can also define a Header and a
Footer for your templates. These can be completed using the Header and
Footer text areas found below the Body text area.

image:188PDF_footer.png[title="PDF Header and Footer"]

[discrete]
===== Generate Letter

You can generate PDF documents for Accounts, Contacts and Leads using
the Generate Letter functionality.

image:image90.png[image90.png,title="image90.png"]

Clicking the 'Generate Letter' button found on these modules Detail View
will prompt a pop-up asking to select a template.

image:image91.png[image91.png,title="image91.png"]

The template selector pop-up will show all the active templates which
have the same Type as the module of the record. Clicking the template
name will generate a PDF document with date populated from the record
and it's related records. The Generate Letter functionality can also be
actioned from the List View. This allows you to select multiple records
and click the 'Generate Letter' button within the List View action menu.

image:image92.png[image92.png,title="image92.png"]

The process for generating PDFs for Quotes, Invoices and Contracts is
described in your respective sections.

=== Quotes Module

[discrete]
===== Creating a Quote

You can create a Quote by going to the Quotes module and clicking
'Create Quote' from within the actions bar. The first panel allows you
to specify details concerning the quote such as the Title, related
Opportunity, Stage and Payment Terms. The Quote Number field is
calculated automatically.

image:96Quotes_first_panel.png[title="Creating a Quote"]

The second panel allows you to specify who the Quote is for by relating
an Account and Contact to the Quote. When you select the Account, the
Billing Address and Shipping Address are dynamically pulled from the
Account and populated into the fields on the Quote record.

image:97Quotes_2nd_panel.png[title="Creating a Quote"]

[discrete]
===== Line Items with Groups

The third panel allows users to specify the Quote Groups, Line Items and
the Currency. A Group is a collection of Line Items with its own Group
Total. A Line Item can be a Product Line or a Service Line. To add a
Quote Group, click the 'Add Group' button.

{{% notice note %}}
Add Group will be displayed if “Enable Line Item groups” is
selected in Admin.
{{% /notice %}}

image:98Quotes_add_group.png[title="Add group"]

This will display the Group, allowing you to insert a Group Name and add
a Product Line or Service Line. It will also display the Group Totals.

image:200Add_group.png[title="Group Display"]

To add a Product Line, click the 'Add Product Line' button. This will
allow users to quote for Products from the Products module.

image:201Add_product_line.png[title="Add Product Line"]

To select a Product, you can start typing in the Product or Part Number
field which will provide a list of results similar to any relate field.
Alternatively click the arrow button next to the Part Number field. This
will display a pop-up window allowing you to select from a list of
Products.

image:202Add_product1.png[title="Select Product"]

Once you have selected a Product, the List, Sale Price and Total will
populate automatically. You can change the Quality, add Discounts
(Percentage or Amount) and increase the Tax percentage. These will alter
the Sale Price, Total Price and Group Total fields. To add a Service
Line, click the 'Add Service Line' button. This will allow users to
quote for Services.

image:203Add_service_line.png[title="Service Line"]

For Service Lines, you must specify the List price. This will populate
the Sale Price. Tax and Discounts can be added similarly to the Product
Line. AOS will keep a Grand Total for each Group.

image:204Total.png[title="Group Total"]

AOS will also keep a Grand Total for all Groups combined.

image:205Total_total.png[title="Combined Total"]

The Shipping field allows you to add a shipping cost. The Shipping Tax
field allows you to add tax to this value. Once the Quote has been
compiled, click 'Save' to save the Quote.

[discrete]
===== Line Items without Groups

Creating Quotes without Groups is very similar to creating Quotes with
Groups. The only difference is you do not have to click 'Add Group'. You
simply 'Add Product Line' and 'Add Service Line' to the quote. Without
Groups you are cannot see the Group Total fields. You will only see the
Grand Total fields.

[discrete]
===== Sending Quotations

To output a Quote you can select one of following three buttons from the
Quote Detail View.

image:99Sending_quotations.png[title="Sending Quotations"]

AOS provides users with three methods of sending Quotes:

* *Print as PDF* – Allows you to select a template and download or save a
PDF of the Quote.
* *Email PDF* – Allows you to select a template then directs you to the
SuiteCRM email client 'Compose' screen. The Quote PDF will be attached
to email and the email will be addressed to the related Contact of the
Quote. This allows you to fill out the email body.
* *Email Quotation* – This directs you to the SuiteCRM email client
'Compose' screen. The email will be addressed to the related Contact of
the Quote. There will be no attachment and the Quote will be displayed
within the body of the email.

[discrete]
===== Convert To Invoice

With AOS you can convert Quotes to Invoices. This can be achieved by
clicking the 'Convert to Invoice' button on the Quote Detail View.

image:100Conver_to_invoice.png[title="Convert to Invoice"]

This functionality will redirect users to the Edit View of an Invoice
record. Fields will be populated based on your Quote counterparts and
Line Items will be copied over. When you are ready to create the
Invoice, click the 'Save' button. Converting a Quote to an Invoice will
set the Invoice Status of the quote to 'Invoiced'.

[discrete]
===== Create Contract

As well as converting to an Invoice, AOS allows users to create a
Contract based on a Quote. This can be done by clicking the 'Create
Contract' button on the Quote Detail View.

image:101Create_contract.png[title="Create Contract"]

This will redirect you to the Edit View of a Contract record, pulling
through any appropriate fields from the Quote. This includes any Line
Items on the Quote.

=== Invoices Module

[discrete]
===== Creating an Invoice

Creating an Invoice record is very similar to creating a Quote record.
You can create an Invoice by going to the Invoices module and clicking
'Create Invoice' from within the actions bar. The first panel allows you
to specify details about the Invoice such as Status and Due Date.

image:102Invoice_panel_1.png[title="Creating an Invoice"]

The second panel allows you to specify who the Invoice is for by
relating an Account and Contact to the Invoice. When you select the
Account, the Billing Address and Shipping Address are dynamically pulled
from the Account and populated into the fields on the Invoice record.

image:103Invoice_panel_2.png[title="Creating an Invoice"]

[discrete]
===== Groups and Line Items

AOS allows users to add Groups and Line Items to Invoices. This is
completed in the exact same way as Quotes. Please refer to Quotes
section for details on how to create Groups and Line Items.

[discrete]
===== Sending Invoices

To output an Invoice you can select one of following three buttons from
the Invoice Detail View.

image:104Invoice_export.png[title="Sending Invoices"]

AOS provides users with three methods of sending Invoices:

* *Print as PDF* – Allows users to select a template and download or save
a PDF of the Invoice.
* *Email PDF* – Allows users to select a template then directs you to the
SuiteCRM email client 'Compose' screen. The Invoice PDF will be attached
to email and the email will be addressed to the related Contact of the
Invoice. This allows user to fill out the email body.
* *Email Invoice* – This directs you to the SuiteCRM email client
'Compose' screen. The email will be addressed to the related Contact of
the Invoice. There will be no attachment and the Invoice will be
displayed within the body of the email.

=== Contracts Module

[discrete]
===== Creating a Contract

AOS allows users to create Contracts using the Contracts module.

image:105Creating_a_contract.png[title="Creating a Contract"]

When the Contract is created the Renewal Reminder Date will populate
automatically based on the amount of days specified in the AOS Settings
in Admin. A Call will be scheduled and assigned to the Contract Manger
for this date.

[discrete]
===== Groups and Line Items

AOS allows users to add Groups and Line Items for Contracts. This is
completed in the exact same way as Quotes. Please refer to Quotes
section for details on how to create Groups and Line Items.

== Advanced Open Workflow

Advanced OpenWorkflow (AOW) is a module for SuiteCRM, allowing users to
create custom workflow processes. This module allows users to trigger
various system actions based on conditions from any SuiteCRM module.

=== Creating a Workflow Process

You can create workflow processes by navigating to the 'WorkFlow' module
within SuiteCRM. Click the 'Create WorkFlow' button within the action
bar to start creating the process. The first panel allows users to set
up the workflow process.

image:106Creating_a_workflow.png[title="Creating a Workflow"]

This allows you to specify the following:

* *Name* – The name of the process.
* *Assigned To* - The assigned user of the workflow process.
* *WorkFlow Module* – A drop down list of all the modules found within the
SuiteCRM instance. This is the module the workflow is run against. For
example, When an Account is created/edited.
* *Status* – Active or Inactive. Only active processes will run.
* *Run* – Always, On Save or On Scheduler.
* *Run On* – All Records, Modified Records or New Records.
* *Repeated Runs* – If checked, the process will continue to run over and
over. Ideally this should only be checked if one of the specified
Actions negates (or will lead to the negation) of one of the specified
Conditions.
* *Description* – A description of the process.

=== Conditions

[discrete]
===== Adding Conditions

Once set up, you can add conditions to a workflow process using the
conditions panel. This allows users to specify the criteria that should
trigger the workflow actions.

image:107Adding_conditions.png[title="Add Condition"]

To add a Condition Line you must click the 'Add Condition' button.

{{% notice note %}}
You must select your WorkFlow Module on the first panel before
adding a Condition Line.
{{% /notice %}}

image:206Add_condition.png[title="Add Condition"]

You can have an unlimited amount of Condition Lines. To add another line
click the 'Add Condition' button again and it will appear. On the line
you will have four fields; Field, Operator, Type and Value.

[discrete]
===== Field and Operator

Field is a drop down which automatically populates with all the fields
found in the WorkFlow Module.

image:109Field_box.png[title="Field Box"]

The Field selected will determine the options available for Operator and
Type. If the field type is not a number or date then the operators
available will be 'Equal To' or 'Not Equal To'. For number and date
fields you can also choose from additional logical operators; 'Less
Than', 'Greater Than', 'Less Than or Equal To' or 'Greater Than or Equal
To'.

image:110Operator_box.png[title="Operator Box"]

[discrete]
===== Condition Types

You can specify workflow processes to trigger on different condition
types. These are as follows:

* *Value* – This is used to directly compare the Field to a value. The value
type offered is dynamic to the field type of the Field selected. For
example, if the field type is a drop down then the value field type will
be the same drop down list.

image:111Value_condition.png[title="Value"]

* *Field* – This is used to action a workflow process when one field is
compared to another field in the record.

image:112Field_condition.png[title="Field"]

* *Multiple* – This can be selected if the Field is a drop down/multiselect.
This allows users to specify multiple values to action the workflow
from.

image:113Multiple_condition.png[title="Multiple"]

* *Date* – This allows you to specify the workflow to occur after/before an
amount of time from either another date field or 'Now'. For example,
when the start date of a call is 'Now + 10 minutes'. This can only be
used when the Field is a date field. The amount of time before or after
the date can be specified in Minutes, Hours, Days, Weeks or Months.

image:114Date_condition.png[title="Date"]

[discrete]
===== Removing Conditions

You can remove Condition Lines by clicking the '-' button on the left
hand side of the condition.

image:115Removing_conditions.png[title="Removing COnditions"]

=== Actions

[discrete]
===== Adding Actions

Actions are defined in the third panel. These specify what events should
occur when the conditions have been met. You can add an Action by
clicking the 'Add Action' button.

image:116Adding_actions.png[title="Add Action"]

This will cause the Action Line to appear.

image:207Action_line.png[title="Action Line"]

From the Action Line you can Select Action and give it a Name. The
actions available are; 'Create Record', 'Modify Record' and 'Send
Email'. You can specify an unlimited amount of actions for each workflow
process.

[discrete]
===== Create Record

If you select 'Create Record' you will be prompted to select a Record
Type. This is the module type of the record you are looking to create.

image:208Create_record.png[title="Create Record"]

Once selected you can add fields or relationships to this record using
the 'Add Field' and 'Add Relationship' buttons.

image:209Add_field-relationship1.png[title="Add Field/Relationship"]

When Adding fields the first drop down in the line will populate with
all the fields from that module. The second drop down allows you to
specify how the value for that field is going to be derived. For most
cases the options are as follows:

* *Value* – This will allow you to input the value directly using the same
field type as the field selected.
* *Field* – This will make the field the same value as a field found in
the WorkFlow Module.
* *Date* – Only selectable if the field is a date field. This will allow
you to specify the value as an amount of time after/before another date
field or 'Now'.

image:210Adding_fields.png[title="Adding Fields"]

Selecting the 'Assigned-To' field also gives you more options. As well
as by value and field you can assign a user by:

* *Round Robin* – This will select each user in turn.
* *Least Busy* – This will select you with the least amount of records
assigned to you for that module.
* *Random* – This will select a random user.

For each of the above options you can choose if you want you to be
selected from all users or users from a specific role. If you have the
SecuritySuite module installed you can additionally choose if you want
you to be selected from all users from a particular Security Group or
all users from a particular security group with a particular role.

image:121Assigned_field.png[title="Assigned Field"]

When adding relationships you must select the related module from the
drop down list then select the record that the new record should be
related to.

image:212Add_relationship.png[title="Add Relationship"]

{{% notice note %}}
You must selected the related module using the arrow button – The
auto completion on the text field is not currently developed.
{{% /notice %}}

[discrete]
===== Modify Record

This provides the same functionality as 'Create Record' but instead of
creating a new record you are modifying the record which met the
conditions of the workflow process. With this action you can modify any
field found within the record or you can add a relationship to another
record. This is completed in the same way as 'Create Record' except you
are not required to specify the Record Type.

[discrete]
===== Send Email

The 'Send Email' action allows users to create workflow processes which
will send an email based on an template to individuals. Using this
action there are four different types of recipient.

* *Email* – This will send an email to a specific email address. You must
specify the email address and the email template.

image:213Send_email_to.png[title="Send Email"]

Record Email – This will send an email to the primary email address
specified on the record which actioned the workflow process. This can
only be used if the record has an email field such as Accounts and
Contacts. For this option you only need to specify the template.

https://suitecrm.com/wiki/media/image127.png[https://suitecrm.com/wiki/media/image127.png]

* *User* – This will send the email to a specified Users email address. You
must specify the recipient user and the template of the email.

image:214Send_email_to_user.png[title="User"]

* *Related Field* – This will send an email to the primary email address
specified on a related modules record. In this case you must specify the
related module (From a drop down list) and the email template.

image:215Email_related_field.png[title="Related Field"]

=== Calculate Fields

If you select 'Calculate Fields' from the Action dropdown the Calculate
Fields user interface will be loaded after a second and looks like the
picture below.

image:216Calculate_fields.png[title="Calculate Fields"]

[discrete]
===== Calculate Fields - Adding parameters

It is possible to add parameters to the formulas by using the dropdown
in the Parameters section of the Calculate Fields’s user interface. The
dropdown contains all of the (basic and custom) fields which belongs to
the module selected in the basic fields section.

To add a parameter, select the field from the dropdown and click on the
Add parameter button. After this action, a new line appears in the
parameter table with the name of the field and the given identifier.

For some fields (dropdowns and multi-selects) an additional dropdown
shown up where the user can select if the raw or the formatted value
should be used in Calculated Fields. The raw format means the value
which is stored in the database and the formatted value means the label
for that database value.

To remove a parameter from the table, simply click on the minus button
in the row of the parameter. Be aware, that if you remove a parameter,
all of the identifiers are recalculated, so the identifiers could change
for fields!

image:217Add_parameter.png[title="Adding Parameters"]

The identifier is used to reference this field when the user creates the
formula. For example all appearances of the \{P0} identifier will be
replaced with the Account’s name in the formula. All parameters are like
\{Px} where x is the sequential order of the parameter. The amount of
the parameters is not limited.

[discrete]
===== Calculate Fields - Adding relation parameters

Relation parameters are very similar to the regular parameters, the only
difference is that the user first selects an entity which is in a
one-to-one or one-to-many relationship with the actual entity.

To add a relation parameter, select the relation first, and then select
the field from the connected entity and push the Add relation parameter
button. After this action, a new line appears in the relation parameter
table with the name of the relationship, the name of the field and the
given identifier.

As for parameters for some relation parameter fields (dropdowns and
multi-selects) an additional dropdown shown up where the user can select
if the raw or the formatted value should be used in Calculate Fields.

To remove a relation parameter from the table, simply click on the minus
button in the row of the relation parameter. Be aware, that if you
remove a relation parameter, all of the identifiers are recalculated, so
the identifiers could change for fields!

image:128Adding_relation_parameter.png[title="Relation Parameters"]

The identifier is used to reference this field when the user creates the
formula. For example all appearances of the \{R0} identifier will be
replaced with the creator user‘s username in the formula. All relation
parameters are like \{Rx} where x is the sequential order of the
relation parameter. The amount of the relation parameters is not
limited.

[discrete]
===== Calculate Fields - Creating formula for a field

In the Formulas part of the user interface the user can add formulas for
fields of the actual entity.

To add a formula, select a field from the dropdown first and then push
the Add formula button. After this action, a new line appears in the
formula table with the name of the field and with the place for the
formula.

To remove a formula from the table, simply click on the minus button in
the row of the formula.

image:129Add_formula.png[title="Add Formula"]

The formula is a textbox where the user can write the formulas. The
module evaluates the formula on the given time (on save, on scheduler
run or both) and fills the selected field with the evaluated value.

The formula can contain any text (with full UTF-8 support), but only the
function parts (functions with parameters between ‘\{‘ and ‘}’) are
evaluated. For example and with the parameters added in the previous
sections, if we fill the formula like: Account \{P0} created by user
name \{R0}, then the description field will have the following value
after save: Account My Account created by user name MyUser (implying the
account’s name is My Account and the creator user’s username is MyUser).

The Calculate Fields has many built-in functions which allows the user
to build complex formulas to achieve various goals. These functions are
described in the next section.

[discrete]
===== Calculate Fields - Usable functions

As it is mentioned above, all of the functions are wrapped between ‘\{‘
and ‘}’ signs, and they look like \{functionName(parameter1; parameter2;
…)}. The count of the parameters are different for the different
functions. The module evaluates the functions and changes them with
their result in the formula.

The functions can be embedded into each other (using a result of a
function as a parameter for another function) like in this example:

 {power({subtract({divide({add({multiply(10; 2)}; 12)}; 8)}; 1)}; 2)}

This function is the formalised look of the following mathematical
expression:

 ((((10 * 2) + 12) / 8) – 1)2 

The functions are divided to six groups. These groups are described in
the next section of the document.

==== Logical Functions

Logical functions are returning true or false in the form of 1 and 0 so
checkboxes typed fields can be filled with these functions. They can be
also used as the logical condition for the ifThenElse function.

==== Example - Calculate monthly fee for an opportunity

===== Use Case

The user would like to calculate a monthly fee of an opportunity to a
custom field by dividing the amount of the opportunity by the duration.

===== Setup

Our opportunities module has a dropdown field called Duration with
values: (database value in brackets) 6 months [6], 1 year [12], 2 years
[24]. There is also a currency field called Monthly.

===== Workflow

Go to WorkFlow module and create a new WorkFlow. Set the base options
like the following:

[cols=",", width="50%"]
|=====================================================
|*Name:* as you wish |*WorkFlow Module:* Opportunities
|*Status:* Active |*Run:* Only on save
|*Run on:* All records |*Repeated runs:* checked
|=====================================================

image:130Example_workflow.png[title="Example Workflow"]

We do not create any conditions, since we would like the WorkFlow to run
on all opportunities.

Now, add an action and select Calculate Fields from the dropdown.

Then, add two fields from Opportunities as parameters. First, select
Opportunity amount (amount) and add it as a parameter (it will be \{P0})
then select Duration and the raw value option from the data type
dropdown and add it as parameter two (it will be \{P1}). There is no
need to add any relational parameters for this formula.

Now, add a formula for the monthly field and fill the textbox with the

Save the WorkFlow and create a new Opportunity:

https://suitecrm.com/wiki/images/5/5a/ExampleCF_orig2.png[https://suitecrm.com/wiki/images/5/5a/ExampleCF_orig2.png]

As you can see, we did not even add the monthly field to the EditView,
because we don’t want to force the user to make calculations. Save the
Opportunity and check the results on the DetailView:

== Advanced Open Cases with Portal

=== Introduction

Advanced OpenPortal (AOP) is an enhancement to the case management
module in SuiteCRM. There is also a Joomla component. AOP extends the
core cases functionality and enhances mechanisms for contacts to update
cases.

This module allows contacts held within SuiteCRM to:

* *Retrieve emails regarding updates to your Cases*
* *Create Cases by emailing a defined support address*
* *Update Cases by replying to Case emails*

The module allows SuiteCRM users to: Add updates to Cases View a
threaded log of all updates Retrieve email notifications when a contact
adds an update to a Case Create Joomla users from a Contact The AOP
Joomla component connects a Joomla site to the SuiteCRM instance. This
allows SuiteCRM Contacts to: View a list of your Cases online Create new
Cases online Reply to existing cases View your case details including a
threaded log of all updates

Emails Advanced OpenPortal (AOP) uses the standard SuiteCRM
functionality to send emails and create cases from inbound emails.
Details on how to configure your outgoing email settings can be found
here. Details on how to set up a group email account which will
automatically generate cases can be found here.

=== Installation & Configuration

System Administrator users can configure the settings by accessing the
AOP settings through the admin panel.

image:145AOP_settings.png[title="AOP Settings"]

Here you can enable or disable the AOP functionality, configure the
Joomla URL, set the case distribution method, “email from” details and
the different email templates.

To install the Joomla AOP component, use the Joomla Extension Manager.
Once installed you must configure the SuiteCRM URL and a valid SuiteCRM
username and password. This can be done by navigating to Components →
advancedopen-portal.

https://suitecrm.com/wiki/media/image146.png[https://suitecrm.com/wiki/media/image146.png]

Once you have configured the Joomla component you can add two new Main
Menu items to your Joomla portal. These are:

* *List Cases* - This shows a list of all Cases that the Contact has
logged. This page also provides a search mechanism to filter cases.
* *New Case* – This page will allow Contacts to create Cases in SuiteCRM
from the Joomla portal.

https://suitecrm.com/wiki/media/image147.png[https://suitecrm.com/wiki/media/image147.png]

=== Using Advanced OpenPortal

==== Creating a Portal User

To create a Portal User a SuiteCRM User must first create a Contact for
the Portal User using the standard SuiteCRM functionality. Once created
you must click the 'Create Portal User' button. This can be found at the
top left hand side of the Contact record Detail View.

{{% notice note %}}
If you have action menus enabled the button will be within the
action menu.
{{% /notice %}}

https://suitecrm.com/wiki/media/image1408png[https://suitecrm.com/wiki/media/image148.png]

Once clicked, a new user will be created in Joomla and the Contact will
be sent your portal credentials via email.

==== Creating a Case via the Portal

Portal Users can create a new Case by going to the New Case page on the
portal website.

https://suitecrm.com/wiki/media/image149.png[https://suitecrm.com/wiki/media/image149.png]

From here Portal Users can enter the details of your issue and attach
any supporting documents. The dropdown values are dynamically pulled
from the SuiteCRM instance and thus can be edited using the drop down
editor tool within SuiteCRM.

{{% notice note %}}
This feature does use the Joomla cache so please clear cache
after an update has been made. When the case is ready to be logged,
click the 'Save' button. This will create the Case within SuiteCRM.
{{% /notice %}}

==== Viewing Cases via the Portal

Portal Users can view a list of all your Cases using the List Cases
page. This will also allow you to filter your search by State (All, Open
or Closed) or by keyword. When searching by keyword it will search the
'Number', 'Subject', 'Status', 'Created' and 'Last Update' fields to
find your result.

https://suitecrm.com/wiki/media/image150.png[https://suitecrm.com/wiki/media/image150.png]

To view more information on the case and to add updates then Portal
Users can click the 'Subject' of case.

https://suitecrm.com/wiki/media/image151.png[https://suitecrm.com/wiki/media/image151.png]

From the case view Portal Users can view all the external updates added
to the case from both Joomla and SuiteCRM. This is displayed in a
threaded format showing who updated the case Any attached files to
updates will also be accessible from this view. When a Portal User
updates a case the assigned SuiteCRM user of the case will be notified
by email.

==== Creating and Updating Cases from SuiteCRM

You can create and update Cases from SuiteCRM. To add an update to an
existing record Users will add text to the 'Update' field within the
case Detail View and click 'Save'. This will publish the update to the
portal and send an email to any Contacts related to the Case.

https://suitecrm.com/wiki/media/image152.png[https://suitecrm.com/wiki/media/image152.png]

If Users check the 'Internal Update' field then the update will appear
in SuiteCRM only. It will not appear in Joomla and the Contact will not
be emailed.

https://suitecrm.com/wiki/media/image153.png[https://suitecrm.com/wiki/media/image153.png]

The Case Detail View will show the full threaded update log.

https://suitecrm.com/wiki/media/image154.png[https://suitecrm.com/wiki/media/image154.png]

Additional Contacts can be added to the Case using the Contacts sub
panel. All emails exchanged between the system, the contact and you will
be attached to the History sub-panel. Any documents attached to the case
using the Portal are held as Notes within this sub-panel.

==== Status Drop Down

Within Cases, you can specify both a State and a Status value. The State
determines if the Case is Open or Closed. Depending on the State you
will be offered different statuses. You can amend these statuses using
the Dropdown Editor Tool within the Admin Developer Tools. When adding a
new Status you must define the Item Name as “<parent dropdown item
name>_ItemName” For example “Open_New” or “Closed_Rejected”. All values
with an Item Name prefixed with “Open_” will show when the state is
Open, similarly all with the prefix “Closed_” will show when the state
is closed.

Once you have added fields to a Report, there are multiple options to
configure for those fields:

* *Display* – True or false option. Allows you to specify whether this
field should be displayed on the report, or hidden. Users may wish to
add fields to perform a function/sort/group/total but may not wish to
show this on the Report.<br/>

* *Link* – True or false option. Allows you to make the field a link.
Setting this option to true will hyperlink the field on the Detail View
